This package contains AminoGUI.java and AminoQuiz.java classes.

AminoQuizGUI imports AminoQuiz to create a Graphical User Interface which allows users to take a quiz guessing the one letter abbreviations of randomly generated amino acids. A count of correct answers is held for each shown amino acid and a score summary is displayed at the end of the game.

The user may select a timer in seconds ranging from 10 to 60, and the game is over when user incorrectly guesses an amino acid, or when the timer runs out. The user can then choose to play again, or quit the game.
