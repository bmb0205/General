 * Created by bmb0205 on 5/22/16.
 * Merge sort algorithm implemented in Java.
 * Best, average and worse case time complexity: guaranteed O(log(n))
 * Space complexity: constant O(n) due to extra arrays being created
 * Algorithm splits array into single elements, then merges them back together
 * in steps
